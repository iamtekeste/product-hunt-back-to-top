# Back to Top button for [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) :heart_eyes_cat: :sunglasses: :ok_hand:
> Chrome extension that adds a fun back to top button

## Why though?
I decided to give unsolicited help to the Product Hunt dev team(:heart_eyes_cat:) with this project. ğŸ˜ƒ

This Chrome extension will add a fun & much needed back to top button to the Product Hunt website.
I like scrolling down through the great products listed here on Product Hunt but I hate having to scroll all the way back up manually, so I created this cute back to top button.


## Dev
``` js
npm run build //this will start babel and watch for file changes
```
